### Code is poetry

  Enthusiast of the world of technology, learning things related to programming, mobile development and design. 
  Producing software with Kotlin, Flutter and other tools in the mobile world. And also other technologies that interest me.

  I always try to write a code that is clean and understandable, as a good poem should be.
